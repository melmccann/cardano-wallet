-- | Resize a generator to grow with the size parameter, but remains reasonably
-- sized. That is handy when testing on data-structures that can be arbitrarily
-- large and, when large entities don't really bring any value to the test
-- itself.
--
-- It uses a square root function which makes the size parameter grows
-- quadratically slower than normal. That is,
